Hey! My portfolio v1 is finally live 😄

I’ve been wanting to ship this for a while, so I’m happy it’s out in the world now.  
Built it with **Astro + Tailwind** and deployed on **Vercel** — super smooth setup.

### What I figured out while building this:
- How to organize components better  
- Basic SEO + accessibility stuff  
- Fixing random bugs I caused myself 😅  
- Deploying without breaking everything (mostly)

### What’s next:
- Dark mode (because… we all need dark mode)  
- A nicer projects section  
- More animations + small UI details  
- Blog improvements

Thanks for checking it out — more upgrades on the way.
